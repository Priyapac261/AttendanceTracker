# AttendanceTracker
Hi there!
I have made this project for the mentorship program Microsoft Engage 2022.

In this, i have made a smart attendance system in which you can add as many students as you want, you can update or delete existing students' details.

It will capture your photos and after training the data, it is able to recognize your face and save your attendance

Before cloning this repo, make sure your system has the following requirements:

1. Desktop development with c++ is installed in Visual Studio 2022.
2. Install python latest version.
3. Install various libraries like opencv, tkinter, cmake, dlib, numpy, pandas etc using pip.
4. If you have not installed mysql, then download the latest version.
5. Make a schema named facerecognition
6. In this schema, make a table named student.
7. Make the columns like - Dep,Year, Regno, name, gender, phone, email.
8. Now, you are good to go, clone the repo and have fun!!
